      <p>
        I am Anurag Anirudha Kelkar, a Computer Science Master's student at
        the University of Florida with a GPA of 3.89/4.0.
        With a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, Distributed
        Systems, and Software Engineering, I enjoy solving complex problems
        and building efficient, scalable software solutions.</br></br>

        I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, DevOps, and
        cloud technologies, having worked as a Graduate Student Assistant (Web
        Developer) at the University of Florida, where I developed
        Python/Flask APIs for OCR processing and optimized React-based
        frontends to enhance user experience.
        My industry experience includes two internships at Securonix India,
        where I worked on CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes microservices, and
        auto-scaling solutions, improving system performance and deployment
        efficiency.</br></br>

        I am proficient in Python, Go, JavaScript, and TypeScript, with
        expertise in frameworks such as React.js, Node.js, and Spring Boot.
        My projects include a Workout Tracker App using React, Go, and
        PostgreSQL, a News Aggregator with NLP-based clustering, and a Library
        Management System using Red-Black Trees for efficient book management.</br></br>

        With a strong interest in cloud computing, DevOps, and distributed
        systems, I am eager to contribute to innovative solutions that drive
        performance and scalability.
        Always looking for opportunities to learn, collaborate, and solve
        impactful problems, I am open to roles in software development,
        DevOps, and cloud engineering.</br></br>
